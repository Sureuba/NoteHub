### Managing Packages with NPM

npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.

**package.json** - stores info on the project, has a single JSON object. Information is stored in Key-Value pairs

2 required fields: name, version

**Creating a package.json**

**Adding Info in the Package.json file**<Br/>
author field: specifies who created the project, string or object with contact detail, etc

ex: "author" : "Jane Doe"
