# Back End Development and APIs NOTES
### FreeCodeCamp.com

Learning: **Javascript** for backend, 
**Node.js** (framework) and **npm** (package manager)

**Express** (framework), **MongoDB** and Mongoose library

### Managing Packages with NPM

npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.

**package.json - What does it do** 
* Stores info on the project, has a single JSON object. 
* Powerful dependency management
* Information is stored in Key-Value pairs.
* Stores metadata.
* 2 required fields: name, version

**Creating a package.json** 
    
    Command: npm init -y (-y will generate the file without questions)

**Adding fields in the Package.json file**<Br/>
author field: specifies who created the project, string or object with contact detail, etc.

    "author" : "Jane Doe"
    "description": "What this project does"
    "keywords": ["Boilerplate", "backend", "freecodecamp"],
	"license": "MIT",
	"version": "1.2.0",

**Adding dependencies**

    "dependencies": {
        "package-name": "version",
        "express": "4.14.0"
    }

Versions follow the **semantic versioning** (SemVer)
Knowing SemVer can be useful when you develop software that uses external dependencies

    "package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"

* MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
* PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes

* Patches - bug fixes
* MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. * MAJORs add changes that wonâ€™t work with earlier versions.

~ : Allow an npm dependency to **update to the latest PATCH version**

    "package": "~1.3.8"

^ : Use the Caret-Character to Use the **Latest MINOR and PATCH Version** of a Dependency

    "package": "^1.3.8"

To remove dependencies:  remove the corresponding key-value pair for that package from your dependencies
